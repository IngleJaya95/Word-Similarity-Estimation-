entitled sue refund taxes paid merged corporation despite section b reorganization followed section liquidation cases hold section inapplicable transfers liquidation appear permit successor corporation sue refund taxes paid transferor fact cash purchase corporation stock followed liquidation might also effective way transfer claim refund kimbell diamond doctrine applied eliminate intermediate step results appear sound stated seaboard numerous cases two primary reasons enactment section united states code prevent government deal one claimant prevent assignment meretricious

reorganization type specified section entitled sue refund taxes paid transferor corporation section united states code interpreted applying claims government transferred tax free reorganizations successor corporations held entitled sue claims tax attributes transferor certain tax attributes corporation whose nature effect might depend facts particular reorganization involved example property

programs past decade scholarship programs mainly aided students best academic records usually middle class students tended use scholarship funds go expensive colleges meanwhile private colleges increased tuition rates much raised economic barrier dwarfs scholarship funds gains educational opportunity past decade taken place largely publicly supported institutions unfortunately however reasons discussed following chapter rate relationships made completely nondiscriminatory long rates must set marginal costs order yield adequate revenues fact may explain disagreements among experts rational formulas apportionment total costs among different units service one disagreement receive attention next chapter concerns question whether rates different kinds service order avoid attribute discrimination must made directly proportional marginal costs whether based instead differences marginal costs choice horns dilemma two major types fully distributed cost analysis double step type despite ambiguity due failure clearly define relative costs exposition fully distributed costing goes far one go toward expressing basic philosophy practice explicit expositions one must distinguish different types analyses means important distinction total cost apportionments superimpose distribution admittedly unallocable cost residues estimates incremental marginal costs apportionments recognize difference true cost allocation mere total cost distribution first double step type might also called railroad type application railroads transportation agencies cost section interstate commerce commission cost section distinguishes directly variable costs constant costs manner noted preceding chapter variable costs alone assigned different units freight traffic representing long run pocket costs term meaning distinctly different economist long run marginal costs remains residue total costs total revenue requirements since found behave constant substantial variations traffic density strictly unallocable cost finding basis nevertheless cost section felt impelled make kind distribution total costs apportioned residue sometimes calls burden among units carload traffic basis partly ton partly ton mile concededly quite arbitrary standpoint cost determination recent years burden includes allowances revenue deficiencies passenger business less carload freight traffic amounted one third total revenue requirements carload freight business supposed called upon meet since book concerned incidentally railroad rates attempt analyze methods staff interstate commerce commission estimated pocket costs apportioned residue costs suffice say usefulness latter apportionment questionable event full credit given cost section express overt recognition vital distinction often ignored utility cost analyses namely cost allocation designed reflect actual behavior costs response changes rates output different classes utility service mere cost apportionment somehow spreads among classes units service even costs strictly unallocable standpoint specific cost determination single step type turn type fully distributed cost analysis unlike railroad type draws distinction cost allocation cost apportionment single step type might called public utility type considerable use put gas electric utility rate cases attempt made first determine pocket marginal costs superimpose costs reasonably distributed residues total costs instead total costs treated variable costs although costs divided costs deemed functions different variables moreover whereas interstate commerce commission parlance variable cost means cost deemed vary direct proportion changes rate output type analysis review variable cost used broadly cover costs function one variable output energy number customers necessarily linear function already noted earlier paragraph familiar cost analyses utility enterprises utility systems divide total costs among number major classes service residential commercial industrial power street lighting etc grand division permits many costs assigned entirety one class street lighting least excluded completely important class classes high tension industrial power service example would charged share maintenance costs capital costs low tension distribution lines major portions total costs utility business common joint nearly classes customers costs must somehow apportioned among various classes must somehow reapportioned among units service order report unit costs serve tentative measures reasonable rates general basis common costs assigned differently measured units service illustrated following highly simplified problem electric utility cost analysis turning example must distinguish two subtypes analysis belong single step type rather double step type first subtype analyst following practice railroad analysis particular respect distributes total operating costs total annual capital costs including allowance cost capital fair rate return among different classes units service apportionment say total costs residential service class would include allowance perhaps per cent cost whatever capital deemed devoted service residential consumers second subtype take one frequently applied operating expenses cost capital fair return apportioned directly among various classes service sure capital investments alternatively estimated fair values plant equipment apportioned among different classes also gross revenues received sales different services resulting excess revenues received given class service operating costs imputed class reported return realized capital investment attributed service thus given year revenues residential service b operating expenses imputed class service come c net investment value plant equipment deemed devoted service amounts cost analyst report residential service aggregate yielded return per cent services show different rates return probably much lower higher obvious reasons convenience practice excluding cost capital direct apportionment annual costs among different classes service notably avoidance controversial question rate return held constitute cost capital fair rate return practice likely misleading since may seem support conclusion long revenues class service cover imputed operating expenses plus return capital investment however low rates charge service compensatory needless say inference would quite unwarranted reason suggested shall assume use first subtype fully distributed cost apportionment following simplified example say allowance cost capital assumed included directly cost apportionment three part analysis costs electric utility business order simplify exposition typical fully apportioned cost analysis let us assume application analysis electric utility company supplying single city power generated steam generation plant let us also assume existence one class type service supplied voltage phase etc residential commercial industrial customers latter assumption permit us center attention controversial aspect modern public utility cost analysis distinction among costs functions outputs service measured along different dimensions since company review supplying regarding one kind service might suppose problem total cost apportionment would simple indeed would limited finding total annual operating capital costs business followed calculation total terms annual cost per kilowatt hour consumption fact however problem simple statement costs per kilowatt hour would ignore fact many costs function kilowatt hour output consumption energy recognition multiple cost functions therefore required simplest division one frequently used subdivisions gas electric rate cases threefold division total operating capital costs customer costs energy volumetric costs demand capacity costs threefold division costs counterpart actual rates charge service actually rates would result three part rate one class service example monthly bill residential consumer might sum customer charge charge kilowatt hours energy per kilowatt hour charge maximum demand kilowatts month rate per kilowatt total bill month present interest lies measurement costs service indirectly rates may may designed cover costs let us therefore consider three types cost turn recognizing simplified classification used illustrative purposes costs actually vary much complex ways customer costs operating capital costs found vary number customers regardless almost regardless power consumption included minimum costs metering billing along whatever expenses company must incur taking another consumer minimum costs may come per month less residential small commercial customers although substantially higher large industrial users require costly connections metering devices costs order sometimes separately charged residential commercial rates form mere service charge frequently wholly partly covered minimum charge entitles consumer small amount gas electricity payment really controversial aspect customer cost imputation arises cost analyst frequent practice including costs definitely earmarked incurred benefit specific customers also substantial fraction annual maintenance capital costs secondary low voltage distribution system fraction equal estimated annual costs hypothetical system minimum capacity preconditions sociology
